# Description

Consider a RAM with the following specification:

1. It contains 512 entries.
2. Each entry has 16 bits.
3. It has two ports. One port for read. The other for write.

The top view of the RAM is shown below.<br>

Specify your target FPGA device as Stratix.<br>
<br>

### My RAM

Design the RAM using only LEs (or ALMs). Your design should use the behavior model. Simulate your circuits. Show the hardware resources consumed by your design from the compilation report.<br>
<br>

### Optional RAM

Design the RAM using only embedded memory bits using MegaWizard Plug In Manager. Simulate your circuits. Show the hardware resources consumed by your design from the compilation report.
